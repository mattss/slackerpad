Slackpad 2003 (v1.0)
by Matthew Sital-Singh

Welcome to Slackpad.
This program is designed specifically for the idle layabout in you
who would rather dream about last night's activities than sit typing
out long documents (in particular Students).

This program can be used as a simple text editor to enter notes and
suchlike - but if that is what you are into then you are using
the WRONG program. (For this reason, there is no 'Save' facility in
Slackpad and so any work you may decide to do will be rendered useless)

Slackpad only comes into its own when the 'Slacker mode' is turned on
(Tools -> Slacker Mode)
You may notice that when you try to 'Open' a text file nothing appears
to happen. This is the beauty of Slackpad.

In 'Slacker' mode, keypresses are not interpreted in the normal way.
Instead of transferring the contents of your typing into the main window, 
Slackpad writes out the contents of the Text file which you previously
'Opened' - making it look as if you are typing the whole thing
out in realtime with no work or thought required on your part!

Try it now!
